 # HelmetBot
 
 HelmetBot is a web service built to make sharing locations and places of interest easier. I thought it was cumbersome having to Google, Copy, and Paste the url of a location. This service allows querying Yelp's API to find any place of interest easily. Since it is a chatbot searching and sharing a Google Maps url is done directly from within your Telegram chats.

## Try it out on Telegram!
Activate this bot by using the **@HelmetBot** command from within any Telegram chat
